1. Worked with branches in this team project. Each one got one branch. And there is a master, which will act as a source of truth.
	Consider some code is in master. To start working, checkout to master -> "git merge master" command, this will merge master code into your branch.
	Work on the code -> and push to your branch. Then go to Github -> A popup will come automatically to create pull request.
	Click create pull request button -> Now the code from your branch will be merged with master.
	Now checkout to master -> do "git pull", merged code will come to master.
	Then, Checkout to your branch and start allover again.
