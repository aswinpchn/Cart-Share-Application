1. To move to different pages, you can use Redirect var method, history and window methods.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50644976/react-button-onclick-redirect-page   (useHistory(), is a concept of hooks. It will work only in functional components. (Functional components is a concept in react 16.))

    I tried to use useHistory() way, it won't work in normal react classes
2. Swal is a great package to show alerts and explain users.

3. Spinners are a good way to show the user, when some api's take time. (Here in this project, API's involving Emails take time, so we have to use spinners in those cases.)
    Bootstrap provides support for spinners using HTML and CSS.

    But if you are using react-bootstrap wrapper, you better use this.    https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/spinners/
