1. Whenever you are opening a springboot project for the first time in your system in Intellij. You have to set-up some things in Intellij. I struggled to figure out what those are.
    a. We have to mark the src folder/ some java folder as "source folder". It can be done by Right click on src folder then Mark Directory as > Sources Root
    b. We have to set the project as a maven project. It can be done by Right click on POM.xml then "Add as maven Project". (If build type is maven)
